<h1>His backstory</h1>
<img src="elvis.JPG" alt="family" style="float: right; width="550px; height="300px">

<p>Elvis was born in June of 2015, but we didn't adopt him until national dog day in August of 2015. By that time he was almost 2 months old and he was the smallest little boy. It was love at first sight when we saw him. He was a scrawny little puppy when we adopted him, but he is now going to be 5 years old next June and he is as chubby and loveable as ever. I got very lucky. Some of his quirks is that he</p>

<ul>
	<li> Has a security blanket</li>
	<li> He walks sideways when he get's excited</li>
	<li> He kneads his blanket like a cat does</li>
	<li> He always has to be covered up when he goes to bed</li>
</ul>

<p> He may be a very spoiled boy he get's toys way too much, and eats way better then other dogs, but he's really a great, great dog.
