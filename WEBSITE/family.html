<h1>My Home Life</h1>

<h3>At home I live with two people, sometimes 3, and my dog.</h3>

<h2> My parents</h2>

<p>Of course I live with my parents! I live with my parents Christina and Dave. They've been married for over 25 years now and I'm so blessed to have such amazing parents that support me on everything that I do and are always there for me in time of need.</p>

<h2>My Sister</h2>

<p> When we were younger, my sister Stephanie and I had the worst relationshp, we didn't like each other in the slightest bit possible. Now that she's 25, and doesn't live with us anymore, we're the best of friends and I could not have asked for a better sister. </p>

<h2>My Dog</h2>

<p>I know I have a whole section about my dog but hear me out, he's such a great dog he has to be talked about more then once. </p>
