<h1>My Studies</h1>

<p> Depending on my schedule for each semester, I go to <a href= "http://www.molloy.edu">molloy college</a> 4-5 days a week, and I love going there. I chose the school because of how welcoming it felt when I toured it. I do much better in a smaller group of classes so I knew this was the class for me. High School was terrible compared to how great my college experience has been so far. One thing that we get to do every semester is dog therapy, and it's honestly the highlight of my semester, being able to pet loads of dogs for 30 minutes at a time. I took a class this semester where we got to meditate for an hour, and I highly reccomend staring a routine of meditating, it does wonders for me. I definitely chose the right college to attend.</p>
